# Predicting the Price of Diamonds

This is a simple project using supervised ML (namely different regression models) to predict the price of diamonds. Both the Jupyter Notebook and the data can be found in the Predicting Price of Diamonds folder. The dataset as from Kaggle, and this project was inspired by Hasib Al Muzdadid's analysis of the same dataset (see link in ipynb file). Mostly this project was to get familiar with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn along with different common ML models.
